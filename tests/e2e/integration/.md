# Integration

Tests in this folder should, most often, only mock:

- Network requests (using MSW)
- Components responsible for animation (because who wants to wait for that in your tests?)

They verify that several units work together in harmony.

For these, it will be important have a few things configured globally like automatically
resetting all mocks between tests.

These may be seen as a subset of E2E tests, which usually use the real application without
any mock!
